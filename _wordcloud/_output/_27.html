    <p>Loved this idea from <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">Episode 097 of Hemispheric Views</a> where they had a <em>Dual of the Defaults</em>! So to join in the fun as everyone else has I decided to make a list of what I use myself. I think the hardest part right now is a lot is in flux as I have started to use a Mac for my work job but more on that another time. However, this is how it looks right now as I am probably in transition still.</p>
