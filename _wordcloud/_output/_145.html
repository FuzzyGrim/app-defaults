  <p>I read <a target="_blank" href="https://manuelmoreale.com/app-defaults">Manuel Moreale's post</a> on "app defaults" and thought it was an interesting idea to think about the software I choose to use so here's mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail Client: Apple Mail at work, <a target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> at home</li>
<li>Mail Server: <a target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a></li>
<li>Notes: <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> / Keynote</li>
<li>To-Do: <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></li>
<li>Photo Shooting: Canon DSLR (I don’t have a smart phone)</li>
<li>Photo Management: Google Photos (but want to move away from Google)</li>
<li>Calendar: Google Calendar (Also want to move this away from Google)</li>
<li>Cloud File Storage: <a target="_blank" href="https://filen.io/">Filen</a></li>
<li>RSS: Inoreader (but wouldn’t recommend)</li>
<li>Contacts: Good question…</li>
<li>Browser: Firefox!</li>
<li>Chat: SMS when out and about, WhatsApp when I have to, Signal when I don’t have to, and Discord at work</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Technically have a <a target="_blank" href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> account but haven’t added in years, tend to put stuff straight into Obsidian now</li>
<li>Read It Later: Don't do that</li>
<li>Word Processing: I don’t think I do that? Maybe Obsidian is enough.</li>
<li>Spreadsheets: Google Sheets (yup…)</li>
<li>Presentations: Keynote</li>
<li>Shopping Lists: Paper (the physical stuff, not an app)</li>
<li>Meal Planning: Don't do meal planning</li>
<li>Budgeting and Personal Finance: Google Sheets</li>
<li>News: Spectator magazine, once a week</li>
<li>Music: Spotify</li>
<li>Podcasts: Not listening to any currently, but have used Pocket Casts</li>
<li>Password Management: Bitwarden</li>
<li>Code Editor: Vim if I’m being quick, VSCode if it’s complex, and Xcode if I have to</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the surprising things about going through this list is the software I <em>don't</em> choose to use.</p>
<p>WhatsApp for example - I've used WhatsApp since it was $0.99 a year and not owned by Facebook, I like the model of paying for something so I was the <em>customer</em> rather than the product being sold to advertisers. Unfortunately it's hard to choose <em>not</em> to use WhatsApp anymore as there's too much expectation and organisation done on WhatsApp. People expect you to be there.</p>
<p>Then there's the bloated crashy mess that is Xcode, which you have to use for iOS development...</p>
<p>There’s still more Google in this list than I’d like. I've been looking at hosting my own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.photoprism.app/">PhotoPrism</a> to replace Google Photos but have never quite got round to it, and I worry I wouldn't keep it up to date with security updates if I did.</p>
<p>I've not yet thought how to replace Google Sheets - I make use of Google Forms going into Google Sheets quite a lot, particularly for budgeting and keeping track of spending, so I don't think LibreOffice would quite work for me.</p>
<p>Once you've been given something for free and it's got its tentacles into the way you work / live / operate, it's very hard to change.</p>
<p>I'll think I'll try and find some other "app defaults" blog posts and see what changes I can make for the better.</p>
