  <p>If you’ve read anything on this blog, you’ll see that I’ve referenced <a target="_blank" href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a> a <a target="_blank" href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-want-whatever-drugs-robb-knight-is-having-except-i-think-the-drug-is-sleep-deprivation">number</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://gkeenan.co/now">times</a>. It’s actually getting out of hand.</p><p>In my defense, it’s only because he is not only extremely smart and attractive, but also because he has very good ideas. One of those very good ideas is <a target="_blank" href="https://rknight.me/app-defaults/">App Defaults</a>, in which he was inspired by a <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">podcast episode</a> (and <a target="_blank" href="https://gabz.blog/2023/11/03/my-defaults.html">this post</a> by Gabz) to list all of the default applications he uses in his computing life.</p><p>As previously established, I am a highly impressionable person and also I am desperate for Robb’s validation,¹ so here’s my own list.</p><p><strong><em>Warning: Do not give me negative feedback on this list. I will print out your email and throw it in the garbage and then light it on fire.</em></strong></p>

I used to use <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-smart-shopping-list/id1195676848"><strong>Grocery</strong></a>, but I find it unnecessary now.</p><p>🍴 Meal Planning: <a target="_blank" href="https://mela.recipes/"><strong>Mela</strong></a> on iPhone/iPad.

I’m also a bit of a purist, so I tend to default to defaults, even if they aren’t quite as robust as other options. There was a time in my life when I was a bit more adventurous, but I largely cannot be bothered,³ and that has been further exacerbated by the fact that I don’t have a corporate job anymore, so most of the shit I’m doing is just for my personal life, and I don’t require much.</p><p>Also computers are boring now, but that’s a post for another day.⁴</p>
