My favorite podcast is currently <a target="_blank" href="https://hemisphericviews.com/">Hemispheric Views</a>.
In <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">episode 97: Duel of the Defaults!</a>
they had a gameshow where they crowned Mr.Default 2023.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by them, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">many other default lists out there</a>,
I had to make my own.
