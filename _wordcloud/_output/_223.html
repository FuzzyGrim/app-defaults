<p>Not sure exactly what default means, but here are the pieces of software I use on my computer that is not a phone.</p>
<p>This list is inspired by many… <a target="_blank" href="https://cagrimmett.com/tech/2023/11/29/default-apps-2023/">Chuck Grimmett</a>, <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/28/my-current-default-apps/" target="_blank">Tracy Darnell</a> and <a href="https://jasper.tandy.is/blogging/default-apps-2023" target="_blank">Jasper Tandy</a> were the nudges through RSS I needed, but <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/" target="_blank">there are over 200 other lists to peruse</a> thanks to <a href="https://rknight.me/" target="_blank">Robb Knight</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig in!</p>
<p>First off, macOS person here. </p>
<p>I sometimes use a Windows machine for Powerpoint against my will (it has way more features than the Mac version). I’ll be honest, I like seeing what Microsoft is up to and generally quite dig the experience!</p>
<p>Back to the Mac apps…</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Photo Editing:</strong> <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html" target="_blank">Lightroom Classic</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Mostly I use <em>Photoshop</em> to edit a single photo, help friends redecorate their home, add crazy hairstyles to snapshots with AI or make memes for text messages.</li>
<li>I use <em>Lightroom</em> to edit large sets of images, picking favorites and applying batch adjustments.</li>
<li>Long ago I purchased presets called <a href="https://vsco.co/store/film/resources" target="_blank">VSCO Film</a> that are increasingly difficult to install, but I often use their Kodak and Agfa filters to process RAW and JPG files.</li>
<li>I changed the default Photoshop icon to an old one because I like it better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image Compression:</strong> <a href="https://imageoptim.com/" target="_blank">ImageOptim</a> <br />To radically reduce the size of images, I use this tool thanks to a tip from <a href="https://nazhamid.com/" target="_blank">Naz Hamid</a>. (It’s messy, but I also keep uncompressed versions of each photo to boot.)</p>
<p><strong>Photo Organization:</strong> I use folders — one for each year, month and day. It looks like this:</p>
<figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories.jpg"><img src="https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories.jpg" alt="Directories of photos organized by year, month and day" srcset="https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories.jpg 3154w, https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories-990x526.jpg 990w, https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories-768x408.jpg 768w, https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories-1536x816.jpg 1536w, https://chrisglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112823-photo-directories-2048x1088.jpg 2048w" /></a><figcaption>Did you know you can take a screen grab of a window without that shadow? Shift Command 4, spacebar, then hold option key when clicking.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Interface Design:</strong> <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a><br />I think the best way to learn something is to work on a project as opposed to going through features. During the beginning of the pandemic I (was bored and not busy) and redesigned my site in Figma, learning how to make interactive demos to click around and explore possibilities. It was a game changer in so many ways… Mostly it inspired thinking systematically about components at every level, which then evolved into thinking about design systems.</p>
<p>I now use the app for every client to realize ideas. It’s kind of amazing, very collaborative and the pricing model is bonkers awful and confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Vector</strong> <strong>Design:</strong> <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">Adobe Illustrator</a><br />For identities, precision icons and quick print work, I use Illustrator. (I still miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_FreeHand" target="_blank">Freehand</a>) I’ll begrudgingly fire up Adobe InDesign for big print work. (Why are bullets so hard?)</p>
<p><strong>Text Editor:</strong> <a href="https://retina.studio/textbuddy/" target="_blank">TextBuddy</a><br />I have this open almost all day as I need to strip out formatting from text. I also have <a href="https://convertcase.net/" target="_blank">ConvertCase</a> bookmarked for ALL THE NONSENSE.</p>
<p><strong>Playing</strong> <strong>Music:</strong> <a href="https://www.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> <br />I also use <em>Apple Music</em> but Spotify has one major benefit (to me) — integration with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to capture listening history which is super valuable when piecing together <a target="_blank" href="https://chrisglass.com/previously-listened/" title="Previously listened">what I listened to</a> a particular day.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Music:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://odesli.co/">Odesli</a><br />Instead of linking to Spotify or whatever, I go to here for sharing songs, albums or on the very rare occasion, podcasts. (Gosh I hope this service lasts forever.)</p>
<p><strong>Podcasts:</strong> …<br />I don’t listen to podcasts and this vexes me, but it is what it is. When I go on a roadtrip I use <a href="https://overcast.fm/" target="_blank">Overcast</a> because it is less confusing than other apps. I wish I went on more roadtrips.</p>
<p><strong>Recipes:</strong> <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/" target="_blank">Paprika</a> <br />I paid for Paprika on every platform (desktop and iOS) and it has been my <em>hands down</em>, go-to favorite way to organize and scrape recipes from the web. (It’s getting long in the tooth though, and I’m starting to want some social features that other recipe apps are baking in to their feature sets.)</p>
<p><strong>Calendar:</strong> Apple Calendar, Google Calendar + <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a><br />It’s annoying to maintain multiple calendars, but I have found scheduling with Calendly is worth the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Grocery List:</strong> Apple Reminders<br />I prefer other methods but this one works with Siri and sorts items by zones in the grocery store automatically. <em>Fine</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Media List: </strong><a href="https://www.sofahq.com/" target="_blank">Sofa</a><br />Whenever someone recommends a movie, book or television program, I add it to Sofa with a note. That way when I stare blankly into the void I have some options.</p>
<p><strong>RSS:</strong> <a href="https://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a><br />I took a break after their AI push but tried other things and just keep coming back this browser based reader. I pay to have search capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Backups:</strong> <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blank">Backblaze</a> <br />Backblaze is for the monster drive of everything I’ve ever made digitally, including all work files and photos. It’s reasonable and unobtrusive and I hope I never really have to use their restoration service. </p>
<p><strong>Filesharing:</strong> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a><br />Dropbox keeps adding features I don’t need and the one feature I do want is buried (the download button). But it works and makes collaboration easy enough.</p>
<p><strong>Browser:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a><br />I’m leaning into Keychain for password management so this makes sense. I also like iCloud tabs. I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> for developer mode. I’m toying with <a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc</a> because it feels exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging:</strong> iMessage for life / <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>, <a href="https://www.signal.org/" target="_blank">Signal</a> and Viber for work<br />I much prefer typing texts on a desktop keyboard, so iMessage integration across devices is <em>awesome</em>, even with notification hiccups. As for all the work comms, I loathe each of these apps. </p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> Apple Mail<br />Also Gmail in the browser to search archives, which isn’t often.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Apple Notes<br />I collaborate with friends on a few lists of ideas and use lots of folders for my own. I very much miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderlist" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a>. Don’t tell me <em>Microsoft Todo</em> is the same. I am eyeing <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, I need a video tutorial. <em>(<a target="_blank" href="https://chrisglass.com/contact/" title="Contact">HMU</a> if you know of one!)</em></p>
<p><strong>FTP:</strong> <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a><br />I don’t need to move files on servers as much anymore, but when I do, I use Transmit.</p>
<p><strong>Video Calling:</strong> <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a><br />The amount of buttons they keep adding might ultimately make me look for an alternative. </p>
<p><strong>Video Compression:</strong> <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a><br />It’s free and does the job of making video files much smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Search Engine:</strong> <a href="https://kagi.com/" target="_blank">Kagi</a><br />It’s not perfect, but for the most part I get the answers I need. And if that doesn’t work I’ll begrudgingly open up a tab and go to that other search engine.</p>
<p><strong>Batch image processing</strong>: <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" target="_blank">Retrobatch</a><br />I often need to fiddle with a bunch of formats to other formats, and this utility makes it easy.</p>
<p><strong>Site Mapping:</strong> <a href="https://octopus.do/" target="_blank">Octopus</a><br />Whenever I start a new project I doodle things out with this site map builder. </p>
<p><strong>Custom Icon Fonts:</strong> <a href="https://icomoon.io/" target="_blank">IcoMoon</a><br />I barely make custom icon fonts, but I do for the tiny handful on this site and always forget what I used, so I’m making note of it here!</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Premium:</strong> Not technically an app but a software subscription I find is worth every penny. YouTube is many things, but mostly a university and incomplete set of encyclopedias.</p>
