<p>Recently, inÂ <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097" target="_blank">episode 097 ofÂ <em>Hemispheric Views</em></a>, which was titled â€˜Duel of the Defaultsâ€™, I had the pleasure of battling it out against my co-host, Jason, to see who had the most default apps installed on their phone. I thought that it would be a fun idea before we recorded the episode, but I had no idea just how hilarious it would be and how many people would get in the spirit online. I think that Andrewâ€™s unexpected, less-than-logical scoring system certainly helped things. ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been truly humbled by the wonderful feedback that weâ€™ve received from listeners, along with blog posts that record their own default app lists. Weâ€™ve even seen involvement from people whoâ€™ve never heard our podcast before, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>After having trouble keeping up, Iâ€™d thought about publishing my own list, then held off because it was already in the episodeâ€¦ but Iâ€™ve since been nudged in our Discord group by Ã¼ber-supportive Hemispherean, <a href="https://rknight.me/" target="_blank">Robb</a>, who has taken on the mammoth task of maintainingÂ <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/" target="_blank">a post of everyoneâ€™s default app lists</a>. What a champion!</p>
<p>Thanks, Robb! Youâ€™re right that my list should be there. Hereâ€™s my list for everyone to enjoy, in all of its â€˜defaultnessâ€™!</p>
