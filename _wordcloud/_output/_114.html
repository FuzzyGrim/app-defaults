    <p>It’s surprising how much attention short-lived trends can attract, even on micro.blog. Recently <a target="_blank" href="https://grepjason.sh/2023/duel-of-the-defaults">one such trend</a> involves compiling lists of go-to software for tasks frequently performed on a computer, the ‘App Defaults’. Robb Knight has already amassed <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">dozens of these lists</a>. I couldn’t help but wonder: which apps do I personally swear by?</p>
<p>Since I rely almost entirely on an iPhone and two iPads (of varying sizes), my set of default apps consists solely of those available on iOS and iPadOS. In the early years of iOS, I had multiple app screens because there were many apps in development and it was enjoyable to try out new ones. However, there is now an app available for nearly every task and several options for each.</p>
<p>To simplify matters, I utilize the same apps on all of my iOS/iPadOS devices, gathered together on one home screen. Additionally, I prefer the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/apps/">standard Apple apps</a> for each task, as they work seamlessly together, with just a few exception when another app is <em>hugely</em> better performing the task.  For web services, I only add one associated app.</p>
<p>However, I make an exception for outdoor activities, reading, and chess, using multiple apps for these purposes. I will detail which apps I use for each in separate posts.</p>

<p>The three apps in my dock, <a target="_blank" href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://anybox.app/">Anybox</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, are my most-used as they effectively organize and combine my tasks on the computer.</p>
<p>As of now my <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">default</a> apps are:</p>
