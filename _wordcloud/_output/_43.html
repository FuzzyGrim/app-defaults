			<p>This is the kind of thing that I find interesting when I look back and see how it changes from year to year so when I saw <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">other people posting their lists</a> I thought I’d join in and keep a record here. I’ve answered with 🖥️ desktop and 📱 mobile icons where they are different, if no icons then I use the same things on all platforms. I started trying to answer just from a mobile point of view, but the list wasn’t nearly as useful to me that way. I feel if I’d done this a few years ago there would have been more Google and these days I’ve gravitated to using the Apple version of apps where I don’t have any pressing need for better versions.</p>
<p>This is the categories from the original list:</p>
<ul>
<li>📮 Mail: Gmail, but I’ve hated it since they trashed the inbox version, I’ve recently retried <a target="_blank" href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> for a better unified mailbox and I think it might stick</li>
<li>📝 Notes: 🖥️ <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, 📱 Apple Notes</li>
<li>✅ To-Do: 🖥️ Obsidian, 📱Apple Reminders</li>
<li>📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: iOS Camera</li>
<li>🟦 Photo Management: Apple Photos</li>
<li>📆 Calendar: Apple Calendar</li>
<li>📁 Cloud File Storage: iCloud</li>
<li>📖 RSS: 📱<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reederapp.com/">Reeder 5</a></li>
<li>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: 📱Apple Contacts, which I kind of forget is actually a thing that there might be alternatives to</li>
<li>🌐 Browser: 🖥️ <a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> is my new best friend, 📱 Safari</li>
<li>💬 Chat: iMessage, Discord, Slack</li>
<li>🔖 Bookmarks: <em>hmm, nothing beyond browsers or putting things into Obsidian really</em></li>
<li>📑 Read It Later: <em>see Bookmarks, I should probably figure out a better setup for both of these categories</em></li>
<li>📜 Word Processing: <em>Pass</em></li>
<li>📈 Spreadsheets: Numbers, some Google Docs still</li>
<li>📊 Presentations: <em>Pass</em></li>
<li>🛒 Shopping Lists: 📱Apple Reminders</li>
<li>🍴 Meal Planning: 📱<a target="_blank" href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika 3</a> but mostly as recipe storage, very little planning happens</li>
<li>💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a></li>
<li>📰 News: <em>no apps, just websites</em></li>

</ul>
