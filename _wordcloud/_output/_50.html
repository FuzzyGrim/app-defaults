<article><div><p>With many <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">people blogging about what app’s they use as their default,</a> and being inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023">Kev Quirk’s post on it</a>, I thought I would list mine.
