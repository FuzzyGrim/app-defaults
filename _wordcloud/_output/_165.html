<div><p>I love the way the web still works without any social media influence. Here's the internet rabbit trail that led me to creating this post:</p><ol><li>I was adding a link to <a target="_blank" href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>, a blog and email hosting service that's cute AND easy AND (relatively) cheap, <a target="_blank" href="https://buttondown.email/lemonpodcasting">to my newsletter</a>.</li><li>While browsing their <a target="_blank" href="https://home.omg.lol/info">help and info page</a>, I saw that they offer a <a target="_blank" href="https://home.omg.lol/info/now">/now/ feature</a> that lets you update the world on what you're working on, reading, watching, etc... now. Old school internet at it's best.</li><li>I clicked through to the <a target="_blank" href="https://now.garden/">omg.lol /now garden</a> which has examples of how people are using /now to update the world.</li><li>I randomly picked <a target="_blank" href="https://beccaowen.omg.lol/now">Rebecca Owen's /now page</a>.</li><li>Then I clicked back through to <a target="_blank" href="https://beccaowen.omg.lol/">her omg.lol page</a> to see how she was using it.</li><li>I saw she had a blog, so <a target="_blank" href="https://beccais.online/">I checked that out</a>.</li><li>The most recent post on Rebecca's blog was one called <a target="_blank" href="https://beccais.online/2023/11/default-apps-2023/">Default Apps 2023</a>. That's clickbait-up-arrow.gif material for me.</li><li>She had included a link to an episode a podcast called <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">Hemispheric Views</a>, and this <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">defaults</a> page.</li></ol><p>Which is how I got around to posting a list of my defaults. No Meta / Twitter / TikTok needed. 😆</p><h3 id="heading-my-defaults-as-of-2023-11-23">My Defaults as of 2023-11-23<a target="_blank" href="https://chrisenns.com/2023/11/app-defaults/#heading-my-defaults-as-of-2023-11-23"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><ul><li>📨 Mail Client - I'm back on  Mail.app.</li><li>📮 Mail Server - Personal is Gmail, my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/">business</a> is on G-suite or whatever it's called this month.</li><li>📝 Notes - A combination of  Notes (shared family stuff), <a target="_blank" href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/?r=dcac6fd924e245dd86621799472ef24e">Notion</a>.</li><li>✅ To-Do - Technically I'm using  Reminders. (<em>See Calendar for more</em>)</li><li>📷 iPhone Photo Shooting -  Camera app</li><li>🟦 Photo Management -  Photos app / PixelMator for graphics.</li><li>📆 Calendar - I recently switched to using <a target="_blank" href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>, but my calendars and to do items are technically saved in  Reminders / Calendar's databases via iCloud.</li><li>📁 Cloud File Storage - I use Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud Drive to keep everything confusing.</li><li>📖 RSS - My RSS feed is stored in <a target="_blank" href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>, and I use Feedbin on my Mac to read RSS feeds. On my iPhone, I'm back using <a target="_blank" href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> but am really tempted to pick up <a target="_blank" href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> and an iPad as dedicated RSS reading hardware.</li><li>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts -  Contacts but with a side of <a target="_blank" href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop">Cardhop</a>, which is included in the Fantastical bundle subscription.</li><li>🌐 Browser - <a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> is my daily driver for most things. I use  Safari for anything I think I might also want on my iPhone. And Chrome sometimes because I'm too lazy to move some bookmarks over.</li><li>💬 Chat - iMessage, <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>, WhatsApp, Slack, FB Messenger, etc. etc. Basically wherever you are, I'll install an app for you.</li><li>🔖 Bookmarks - Safari's built in bookmarks bar is my default, and then I save bookmarks in a Notion database that I never remember to look at.</li><li>📑 Read It Later - <a target="_blank" href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader by Readwise</a>. I love the way it integrates with Readwise to show me highlighted quotes from articles I've read.</li><li>📜 Word Processing - Word what now? I guess Notion is where I write longer things down.</li><li>📈 Spreadsheets - I usually reach for Google Sheets for quick calculations, Numbers if it's something I know I want to keep, or <a target="_blank" href="https://soulver.app/">Soulver</a> for my end of the month "is there enough money in the account to pay the bills" style budgeting.</li><li>📊 Presentations - I don't give many, but if I did I'd use  Keynote.</li><li>🛒 Shopping Lists - A shared Reminders list. iOS17's improvement of sorting the grocery list is a nice bonus.</li><li>🍴 Meal Planning - We have a family <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika</a> account that works, but we don't use it all the time.</li><li>💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance - I've been using <a target="_blank" href="https://lunchmoney.app/?refer=xs6ss9to">Lunch Money</a>, but it keeps losing the connection to my bank accounts which I don't think is Lunch Money's fault and is more to do with banks not wanting to give up your data.</li><li>📰 News - Generally RSS, Threads, or Mastodon. Apple News+ if I have to dig into something more.</li><li>🎵 Music - Apple Music via the Apple One Family bundle. Price increases have me thinking of going back to CDs though.</li><li>🎤 Podcasts - 99% of the time I use <a target="_blank" href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, and occasionally try out  Podcasts, Spotify, etc. as part of keeping up with my client's shows.</li><li>🔐 Password Management - We're on a <a target="_blank" href="https://1password.com/personal">family 1Password</a> plan. If I wasn't on a discounted promo plan of some sort, I'd definitely be looking into the updated  <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlc00a3602/mac">shared password</a> set up since that's just easier in the  ecosystem these days.</li></ul><p>What are your defaults these days?
