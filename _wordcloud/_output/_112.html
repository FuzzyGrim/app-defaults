        <p>Within the podcasting universe, there is a hidden gem, the <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/?ref=merecivilian.com">Hemispheric Views</a>. If you have not heard of it, I rather not ruin it for you.. Go listen to the most recent episode and decide for yourself. You are in for a treat. I already envy your position thinking about it.</p><p>Anyway, this blog post is 100% inspired from <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097?ref=merecivilian.com">Episode 097 - Duel of the Defaults</a> and from the over <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/?ref=merecivilian.com">100 blog posts</a> that have also been inspired from this one episode of Hemispheric Views. Rob Knight has kindly listed all these blog posts <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/?ref=merecivilian.com">here</a> for your enjoyment.</p><p>I honestly was not intending to write this blog post because I am going through a transition away from Apple apps/services in general. Therefore, you may notice that this is more of an Anti Default app blog post.</p><p>📮 Mail Server: Google Workspace (grandfathered into free plan 😆) and <a target="_blank" href="https://mxroute.com/?ref=merecivilian.com">MxRoute</a></p><p>📨 Mail Client: <a target="_blank" href="https://merecivilian.com/merecivilians-default-apps-2023/hey.com">HEY Email </a>(<a target="_blank" href="https://merecivilian.com/hey-is-the-rolex-of-email/">Why HEY</a>)</p><p>📝 Notes: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/?ref=merecivilian.com">Notion</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tot.rocks/?ref=merecivilian.com">Tot</a></p><p>✅ To-Do: <a target="_blank" href="https://merecivilian.com/merecivilians-default-apps-2023/todoist.com">Todoist</a></p><p>📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: Google Camera and Apple Camera</p><p>🟦 Photos Management: Google Photos</p><p>📆 Calendar: Google Calendar and Fantastical</p><p>📅 Calendar Backend: iCloud and Google</p><p>📁 Cloud File Storage: <a>Dropbox</a></p><p>📖 RSS: Feedbin</p><p>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts Management: iCloud</p><p>🔎 Browser: <a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/?ref=merecivilian.com">Arc</a> on MacBook, Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS</p><p>💬 Chat: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeper.com/?ref=merecivilian.com">Beeper</a> (all chats in one app: WhatsApp, Google Messages and iMessage) </p><p>🔖 Bookmarks: <a target="_blank" href="https://raindrop.io/?ref=merecivilian.com">Raindrop</a></p><p>📑 Read-it-Later: <a target="_blank" href="https://readwise.io/read?ref=merecivilian.com">Reader from Readwise</a></p><p>📜 Word Processing: what is that???</p><p>🛒 Shopping List: Apple Reminders</p><p>💰 Budgeting and finance: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.money/?ref=merecivilian.com">Moneywiz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://frollo.com.au/?ref=merecivilian.com">Frollo</a></p><p>📰 News: Feedbin, <a target="_blank" href="https://mailbrew.com/?ref=merecivilian.com">Mailbrew</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news?ref=merecivilian.com">ABC News</a>, BBC News</p><p>🎵 Music: Spotify and YouTube Music</p><p>🎤 Podcast: <a target="_blank" href="https://pocketcasts.com/?ref=merecivilian.com">Pocket Casts</a></p><p>🔐 Password Management: 1Password</p><p>Actually, this had been fun. I provide zero context or reasonings why I use these apps and services, but that makes this list fun. It’s my list. Take it or leave it. </p><p>I can tell you, 5 months ago, most of the apps listed above would have been Apple focused. Kinda pleased with where I am at the moment where I am enjoying life living in multiple ecosystems. Strangely, it works well, dare I say, better than it did when I was only in Apple’s ecosystem. Living like this provides me with the opportunity to use the best features of every ecosystem and disregard the terrible ones.</p><p>Anyway, have a great weekend.. Be kind.</p>
