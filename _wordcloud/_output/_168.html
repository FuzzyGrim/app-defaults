  <p>There’s been a <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">trend floating</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://rknight.me/app-defaults/">around</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/">the</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://jasonfry.co.uk/blog/app-defaults/">blogosphere</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://calebhearth.com/apps-i-use-2023">this</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.josemunozmatos.com/blog/my-app-defaults-2023-edition">month</a> looking at the default apps people are using… I like that. This is my list:</p>
<h2>📨 Mail Client</h2>
<p>I’ve got far too many email addresses… and I’m checking each of them via webmail on the desktop. Mostly Google Workspace / Gmail. I don’t like this solution. I really should get back into a proper mail client in 2024!</p>
<h2>📮 Mail Server</h2>
<p>For my personal account it’s Google Workspace behind the scenes. I want set and forget. This does that for me.</p>
<h2>📝 Notes</h2>
<p>I had a time with Notion over the last few years, however I’ve mostly reverted back to markdown files for serious notes, or a one-liner in a WhatsApp chat with myself!</p>
<h2>✅ To-Do</h2>
<p>At work… Asana. Out of work it’s the wild-west of what I remember next!</p>
<h2>📆 Calendar</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://cron.com/">Cron</a> has been a game changer this year.</p>
<h2>📁 Cloud File Storage</h2>
<p>I’ve been with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AAA8vbnFzkbKTPBYLY1v69OIzqR_vwcc1H8?src=global9">Dropbox</a> for forever. I don’t see that changing any time soon.</p>
<h2>📖 RSS</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> has been in my life for a long time. I recently cleared out all the subscriptions and started again with it.</p>
<h2>🌐 Browser</h2>
<p>This year I’ve been experimenting with <a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a>. I can’t get it to stick for web dev work (which I’m still using Chrome for), but for every-day browsing, Arc is working well for me.</p>
<h2>💬 Chat</h2>
<p>I switching into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> half way through the year… having WhatsApp, SMS, Signal, and Telegram all in one makes me very happy.</p>
<h2>📑 Read It Later</h2>
<p>On a good day <a target="_blank" href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> is the tool for the job. My experience with this is that I go in waves with it– I add a lot of things into it, and then forget to go and read the articles, and then looking at the list is overwhelming… So I forget about it and come back to it, wipe it, start again, and then have the same issue all over again.</p>
<h2>📜 Word Processing</h2>
<p>Google Docs and <a target="_blank" href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>.</p>
<h2>📈 Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>Rarely. Almost never.</p>
<h2>📊 Presentations</h2>
<p>Keynote. It’s solid and reliable. I experimented with <a target="_blank" href="https://ia.net/presenter">Presenter from iA</a> last year. I loved it, but I put presentations together so infrequently that I couldn’t justify the sticker price.</p>
<h2>🎵 Music</h2>
<p>Spotify. Not sure if I should feel bad about this one at the moment.</p>
<h2>🦣 Mastodon</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://elk.zone/">Elk</a> as a PWA, across all devices.</p>
<h2>🎤 Podcasts</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> has been solid for years. It also has a simple Amazon Alexa skill which works well.</p>
<h2>🔐 Password Management</h2>
<p>I’ve been running off KeePass for years, running <a target="_blank" href="https://macpassapp.org/">MacPass</a> on MacOS, and <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Keepass2Android</a> on my phone.</p>
