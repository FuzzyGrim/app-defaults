			<p>Last week at <a target="_blank" href="https://events.indieweb.org/">Homebrew Website Club</a> I was expressing my excitement over the default apps jam going around (if you haven’t seen it yet, it’s sharing which applications folks use for a specific list of functions, <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">inspired by a podcast</a>). This trend is the first big network effect I’ve seen in the blogosphere. <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">More than 200 people have joined in</a> — those are social media numbers! <em>With blogs!</em> 🙌 There’s a neat <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/network/">“network” view</a> that visualizes how the posts interlink.</p>
<p>Someone asked if I’d posted my own yet, and I explained that I hold myself back from participating in stuff like this… because I’m chary of posting things just for fun? Uhhh, didn’t realize that till I said it out loud! (I may also have some residual iffiness over “things we all do together” from one friend being super into BuzzFeed quizzes back in the day?)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://artlung.com/">Joe Crawford</a> chimed in that he likes it when people do fun things on their websites — and we should do more. I agree! I like fun things on personal websites! And I love people being social with their websites. So, in the spirit of supporting a lively blogging scene and making myself have some dang fun, I’m joining in 😄</p>
<p>I’m on Windows and Android, not Apple — so I use a lot of Microsoft and Google products.</p>
<h2>My default apps in 2023</h2>
<p>📨 <strong>Mail Client: </strong><em>Gmail</em></p>
<p>📮 <strong>Mail Server:</strong> I think my custom domain emails go through my webhost’s mail servers? 🤔 Like DNS, I find email behind-the-scenes to be semi-mystical and one of those over-my-head “if you touch it you’ll break it” things 😂 I have only correctly configured half of my custom domain email accounts so I don’t trust them and thus don’t use them 😓 leaving me stuck using my gmail account for everything *sad trombone* (Or I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s some Google-blocking-small-mailservers thing since the settings all match but some send, some receive, and one seemingly does both 🤷‍♀️)</p>
<p>📝 <strong>Notes: </strong><em>OneNote</em> and scraps of paper 😎</p>
<p>✅ <strong>To-Do: </strong>💚 <em>Excel</em> 💚 for my backlog, post-its on a kanban (white)board in my office for current to-dos</p>
<p>📷<strong> Photo Management: </strong>Do other people actually manage their photo libraries? 👀 I should do that maybe. I’m on Android, my photos back up to OneDrive 🤷‍♀️ Sometimes I delete bad photos 😂</p>
<p>📆<strong> Calendar: </strong><em>Google Calendar</em></p>
<p>📁 <strong>Cloud File Storage: </strong><em>OneDrive</em></p>
<p>📖 <strong>RSS: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a></em> because I’m legacied in to having more than 100 feeds for free — I access it primarily through the browser on my phone to discourage myself reading too much but it has not proven a sufficient deterrent 😉</p>
<p>🙍🏻‍♂️ <strong>Contacts: </strong>I wouldn’t say I <em>manage</em> my contacts… but they are technically, theoretically stored in <em>Google</em>, who “helpfully” added everyone I emailed from like 2006 – 2010, except not the people I actually want saved, so I can email someone I did one group project with in 2006 or the help desk person from an order placed in 2009, but it can’t find my cousin’s current email address 😒</p>
<p>🌐 <strong>Browser: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></em> on desktop; <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">DuckDuckGo</a></em> and <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Firefox</a></em> on Android</p>
<p>💬 <strong>Chat: </strong><em>Discord</em> is my preference; <em>WhatsApp</em> is extremely begrudgingly on my phone for the <em>one friend </em>who cannot communicate with any other platform 😒 (If I like you well enough to keep a Meta product on my phone I really like you 😉)</p>
<p>🔖 <strong>Bookmarks: </strong><em>My website</em> 😎 using the <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/">IndieWeb Post Kinds plugin</a> on WordPress with Classic Editor</p>
<p>📑 <strong>Read It Later: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a></em> — but I hate that now it sends you to the original website instead of using their nice reading view for any site with a paywall 😑 so I might be in the market for a replacement…</p>
<p>📜 <strong>Word Processing: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">Scrivener</a></em> for fiction, <em>Microsoft Word</em> for everything else</p>
<p>📈 <strong>Spreadsheets: </strong>💚 <em>Excel</em> 💚</p>
<p>📊 <strong>Presentations</strong>: <em>PowerPoint</em></p>
<p>🛒 <strong>Shopping Lists: </strong>I take a photo of my fridge whiteboard for grocery shopping, <em>Pinterest</em> 😕 for saving items to my wishlist</p>
<p>🍴 <strong>Meal Planning: </strong>I stash recipes on <em>OneNote</em> because it’s the notes app my husband prefers (why)</p>
<p>💰 <strong>Personal Finance: </strong>💚 <em>Excel</em> 💚</p>
<p>📰 <strong>News:</strong> I rely on my RSS and <a target="_blank" href="https://micro.blog/"><em>micro.blog</em></a> feeds to keep me in the loop on current events</p>
<p>🎵 <strong>Music: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a></em> on desktop — I find it a bit overwhelming and confusing though; <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aimp.ru/">AIMP</a></em>, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandcamp.android">Bandcamp</a></em>, and <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mp3">Amazon Music</a></em> (for my purchased music libraries) on Android (plus <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble">PanoScrobbler</a></em> for last.fm scrobbling) — I am currently <em>sans</em> streaming service and I have not yet figured out a way to play music I own from my desktop on my phone so I’m dealing with three apps to access a mere portion of my music library 🙄 I think I need a home music server.</p>
<p>🎤 <strong>Podcasts:</strong> I don’t listen to podcasts regularly, so I listen to any one-offs in my browser</p>
<p>🔐 <strong>Password Management: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a></em></p>
<h2>More apps</h2>
<p>📷<strong> Photo editing: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/">Affinity Photo</a></em> on desktop; <em><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.lrmobile">Adobe Lightroom</a></em> on Android — I may have to get Creative Suite again for an upcoming project though :/</p>
<p>📄 <strong>Document design: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/">Affinity Publisher</a></em></p>
<p>⌨️ <strong>Blogging:</strong> in browser on both desktop and mobile; on Android I use the <em>WordPress app</em> for bulk image uploads but I believe it doesn’t work for <em>posting</em> on WordPress.org sites, either that or I borked the setup 😂 (or it’s my stupid webhost with the mod_security issue again)</p>
<p>👩‍💻<strong> Code for my websites: </strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></em></p>
<p><strong>♥ Health:</strong> <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a></em> on Android; 💚 <em>Excel</em> 💚 on desktop</p>
<p><strong>⏳ Time tracking</strong>: <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a></em>, at this point mostly to track how much time I spend browsing on my phone… which come to think of it, my phone tracks for me, so I could probably stop using this 🤔</p>
<p>📄 <strong>PDF reader:</strong> <em>Adobe Acrobat</em> on both desktop and mobile</p>
<p>📃 <strong>PDF writer:</strong> <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cutepdf.com/index.htm">CutePDF</a></em></p>
<p>I also have a more comprehensive <a target="_blank" href="https://cascadiainspired.com/about/tools/">list of “tools” I use</a> over on my old blog.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see more people’s default apps lists, <a target="_blank" href="https://rknight.me/app-defaults/">Robb Knight</a> has <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">collected a list</a> of more than 200 participants and growing (it was at 200 yesterday and 208 today!). A few people who I’ve seen chime in with theirs are <a target="_blank" href="https://benji.dog/articles/defaults-2023/">Benji</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-08">Colin Walker</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://manuelmoreale.com/app-defaults">Manuel Moreale</a>. It also has a template of the list if you’d like to join in too 😉</p>
