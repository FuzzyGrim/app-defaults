		<p>I get a lot of questions about the gear I use, so I’ve collected it all here on a single page.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of quick notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Just because I use something doesn’t mean I recommend it to everyone. I make stuff for a living and have been fortunate enough to upgrade equipment over time. If you are starting out, there are many great options that cost less. There’s loads of reviews out there to use when learning about gear.</li>
<li>This page uses affiliate links.</li>
<li>Some of these products are sponsors of 512 Pixels and/or Relay FM in the past/present/future. However, unless noted, I’ve paid for everything on this list.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Studio</h2>
<p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILZCCukXKXA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></span></p>
<p>My studio — dubbed the PodCabin — sits behind the garage in our backyard. The original section was built in the 1970s as a space for storage and projects. We added to it in the summer of 2021, doubling the square footage.</p>

<p>This custom sign — along with the baseball bat from the Podcastathon for St. Jude — hangs above the door.</p>
<h2>Computing</h2>
<p>My computer is a silver 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro, 32 GB of RAM and an 8 TB SSD. Everything — including the Studio Display — runs through a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3KEgyM2">CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt dock.</a></p>
<p><img src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023-02-28-desk.jpg" alt="My desk" /></p>
<p>This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://512pixels.net/downloads/files/Hackett-Desk-IO.png">rough flow of things.</a></p>
<p>The computer lives atop a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html">Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk,</a> I generally stand for the first few hours of the day or whenever I have a lot of administrative work to knock out.</p>
<p>Under the display is my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck">Stream Deck XL.</a></p>
<p>In terms of backups, I use a combination of Time Machine, <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01ixl8">Backblaze</a> and a set of off-site drives that I manually update with <a target="_blank" href="https://bombich.com/">Carbon Copy Cloner.</a></p>
<p>I also have a PC I built a couple of years ago for video streaming and capture. It has a 10th-gen Intel Core i7, an RTX 3080 and some RGB. It sits under my home-built overhead shooting rig that is home to <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pGcZJ4">a pair of Sony a6400 cameras</a> being piped into the PC via HDMI. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light">lights</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-4k60-pro">capture cards</a> are all from Elgato. The desk is an old door that I took out of our house when we moved in.</p>
<p>(I also use an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an iPad mini.)</p>

<h2>Podcast Recording</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.relay.fm/people/stephenhackett">I make podcasts</a> for a living. If I’m recording in my home studio, I use this set of gear:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XtsuYF">Neumann KMS 105 MT Condenser Microphone</a> XLR microphone with <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Yz4EJ6">this shock mount,</a> on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-mic-arm">Elgato Wave Mic arm.</a></li>
<li>The microphone is plugged into <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2uHDCAw">a Rolls mute switch,</a> and then into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/">a Sound Devices USBPRE2 interface.</a></li>
<li>My headphones used to be <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Fq7jMn">the boring but reliable Sony MDR-7506s</a>, but I now use a set of <a target="_blank" href="https://custom.ultimateears.com/products/ue-7">custom Ultimate Ears 7 CSX in-ear monitors.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember when I said I couldn’t recommend my gear to most people? The USBPRE2 is awesome, but it is obscenely expensive. My go-to recommendation is the very-good-and-affordable <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2h7KXpP">Tascam US-2×2 USB Audio Interface.</a> On the microphone front, I am a big fan of the <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2sxQn3V">Shure BETA 87A.</a> If you need something really affordable, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/11/a-podcast-studio-for-under-100/">this post by Jason Snell on Six Colors</a> about the <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2BgfIne">Audio-Technica ATR2100 microphone.</a></p>
<p>I record my audio (and what I hear via Zoom) using <a target="_blank" href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a> and I edit in <a target="_blank" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309?mt=12&amp;at=11lt96">Logic Pro.</a></p>
<p>My studio is covered in a bunch of acoustic foam, mainly in these two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nextacoustics.com/brands/NextFoam.html">2″ SoundTraxLG PRO Studio Acoustic Foam</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fuwyOO">Auralex Acoustics Studiofoam</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Podcasting on the Road</h3>
<p>Every year, When there’s not a pandemic sweeping the planet, we host several live recordings of Relay FM shows. Beyond that, I often find myself recording while traveling for work or pleasure. I’ve put together a pretty robust “mobile” setup over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a set of <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2vcAnE4">Shure 87A microphones</a> for our live shows. We have them in some pretty simple table-top stands with big heavy weights to keep them from tipping over.</li>
<li>The mics are run to a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Jl6Idt">Sound Devices MixPre-10</a> which is one of the very few interfaces that can record onto an SD card <em>and</em> send audio out over USB. The device is powered via USB-C, straight into my MacBook Pro, where I capture the audio via <a target="_blank" href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro.</a></li>
<li>If we are in a theatre, I route audio out of the headphone jack of the MixPre-10 to the house via XLR through a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Jp30G2">Radial ProD2 direct box.</a> I’ve joked that this is my favorite piece of tech I own, and I may mean it. It’s built like a tank and does its job very well.</li>
<li>All of this gear is crammed into a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Fdmdp0">Pelican 1510 case</a> for flights. This case is amazing. It is incredibly well made and will fit into most overhead bins without any issue. My wife spray-painted the word “Relay” in gold across the front of it to make mine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>YouTube Videos</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/512pixels">My YouTube channel</a> is a single-person show, so I edit and shoot myself alone in my office, which is challenging at times.</p>
<p>I am shooting in 4K on a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ukdQmm">Sony a7 IV</a> I love this camera. 4K looks awesome, and with the Mac Pro, I can edit it without wanting to throw my computer out the window. I have just two lenses for it. The first is the <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2AdtlAO">Sony FE f/2.8 24-70mm,</a> while the second is this <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2uHCDAn">tiny f/1.8 50mm.</a></p>
<p>I also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jlraAo">Sony a6400</a> that I use for some shots, and as my carry-it-around camera for situations where I need more power than what my iPhone affords me.</p>
<p>For audio, I use the <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pEc3Vq">Rode Wireless Go System</a> paired with <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oVZCVP">the Rode Lavalier GO microphone.</a></p>
<p>I have a couple of LED panels <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1146131-REG/aputure_hr672kit_wws_amaran_3_point_2_flood_1_spot.html">I picked up online</a> that I use for lighting.</p>
<p>I edit my videos in <a target="_blank" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12&amp;at=11lt96">Final Cut Pro X</a> and upload to YouTube. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/512pixels">GO SUBSCRIBE!</a></p>
