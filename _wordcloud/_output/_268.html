<div> <article> <section>  <ol> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.lyokolux.space/tags/app">app</a> </li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.lyokolux.space/tags/RSS">RSS</a> </li> </ol> </section>   2023-11-20  <hr />   <p>With <a target="_blank" href="https://rknight.me/so-many-default-apps/">so many default apps from Robb Knight</a> landing into my RSS feeds, I got intereseted by the apps other people uses by default and the ones listed on <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">https://defaults.rknight.me/</a></p>
<p>So let’s share mine as it is easy to write.</p>
<h2 id="-mail-client">📨 Mail Client</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/">Protonmail</a> is the defacto free and good version for private emails. I use their web UI to read and write emails and their app on smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="-mail-server">📮 Mail Server</h2>
<p>As the mail is hosted by Protonmail, I use their servers as hosting. So it is not applicable in my case.</p>
<h2 id="-notes">📝 Notes</h2>
<p>Everything I notes is written in an <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault. My notes are then organized using the PARA method: Project, Area, Resource and Archive.</p>
<h2 id="-to-do">✅ To-Do</h2>
<p>Pen &amp; Paper 📝 When a task needs to be done, it is added, and when done, it is checked. That’s it and it works well. I do some daily todo-list, and I added a weekly todo.</p>
<h2 id="-photo-shooting">📷 Photo Shooting</h2>
<p>Well the simple camera of any smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="-photo-management">🟦 Photo Management</h2>
<p>My phone Gallery app and I upload the rest to my cloud file storage. KISS on this as it is not so much important for me.</p>
<h2 id="-calendar">📆 Calendar</h2>
<p>The calendar of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simplemobiletools.com/">Simple Mobile Tools</a> fits my need.</p>
<h2 id="-cloud-file-storage">📁 Cloud File Storage</h2>
<p>A 2TB lifetime plan with <a target="_blank" href="https://pcloud.com/">pCloud</a> is well enough at the moment. It keeps the document reachable accross devices.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea">Liferea</a> is my go to on my desktop. I organize the feeds in folders and subfolders. It can carry the XXX feeds I have at the moment and it is enough.</p>
<p>I use the simple Contact app of the phone and call it a day. I don’t need it that much.</p>
<h2 id="-browser">🌐 Browser</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> on both smartphones and desktops. Nothing else except to test web UIs in browsers.</p>
<h2 id="-chat">💬 Chat</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">Whatsapp</a>. I promote Signal above all else; Telegram is useful for friends, and Whatsapp for family in general.</p>
<h2 id="-bookmarks">🔖 Bookmarks</h2>
<p>Most happens on my selfhosted <a target="_blank" href="https://shaarli.lyokolux.space/">instance of Shaarli</a>. I use the bookmarks of the browser too, sometimes with specific names or namespaces to find them again, and the “marked” state of the RSS reader Liferea.</p>
<h2 id="-read-it-later">📑 Read It Later</h2>
<p>Well, it is the same as with the bookmarks: reading on the fly happens with a specific tag on Shaarli. It allows to access the resource from any device with an internet connexion. I mark some in Liferea directly and open my reader to get them on the couch. It goes in pair with my bookmarks.</p>
<h2 id="-word-processing">📜 Word Processing</h2>
<p>n/a</p>
<h2 id="-spreadsheets">📈 Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>I don’t use them anymore, but it was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/">Libreoffice</a> all the way.</p>
<h2 id="-presentations">📊 Presentations</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://sli.dev/">slides.dev</a> for small and quick presentations. I was using PowerPoint for some projects at the university though.</p>
<p>I somehow came to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flatastic-app.com/">Flatastic</a> while I was living in a shared flat. I’ve kept it that way ever since.</p>
<h2 id="-meal-planning">🍴 Meal Planning</h2>
<p>/tree/master/src
What is in the fridge, then I have a shopping list and that’s it.</p>
<h2 id="-budgeting-and-personal-finance">💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance</h2>
<p>n/a</p>
<h2 id="-news">📰 News</h2>
<p>A lot goes with RSS or <a target="_blank" href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. I also get some from friends 😱 For the society news (especially France), I use the channel of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAcAnMF0OrCtUep3Y4M-ZPw">Hugo Décrypte</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-music">🎵 Music</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://spotify.com/">Spotify</a> while working or to have some sound. I also use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tramhao/termusic">termusic</a> for local files and custom playlists.</p>
<h2 id="-podcasts">🎤 Podcasts</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc">VLC app</a> or the pCloud music player. I always download them and put them in a <code>~/resources/podcasts</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="-password-management">🔐 Password Management</h2>
<p>A simple <a target="_blank" href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeepassXC</a> local database that is synced accross my devices works well for now.</p>
<hr />
<p>At some point I am considering a self-hosted Nextcloud instance for the daily business: Contacts, Agenda &amp; Calendar, Tasks, etc…</p>
<p>and have a good day!</p>  </article> </div>
