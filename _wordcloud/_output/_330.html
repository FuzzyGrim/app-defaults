<div><p><em>A list of most of the apps I use across my devices</em></p><hr /><p>A bit late to <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/" target="_blank">the party</a> but here I go:</p><ul><li><strong>Email:</strong> iCloud + Default Mail app</li><li><strong>Browser:</strong> Arc + Safari</li><li><strong>Task management:</strong> Things + Reminders</li><li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> mymind</li><li><strong>Photo shooting:</strong> Default camera app + Halide + Spectre</li><li><strong>Photo editing:</strong> Lightroom</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong> Apple Notes + Bear + Notion for work</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> iA Writer</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Figma + PixelMator Pro</li><li><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Cleanshot X</li><li><strong>Finance:</strong> My bank’s app</li><li><strong>Read later:</strong> GoodLinks</li><li><strong>Password manager:</strong> 1Password</li><li><strong>Music:</strong> Apple Music</li><li><strong>Messaging:</strong> WhatsApp</li><li><strong>Sport:</strong> Suunto + Freeletics</li></ul><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><h3 id="email">Email</h3><p>Not much to say here. I neither write nor receive enough emails to justify anything more powerful than the default <strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/mail" target="_blank">Mail</a></strong> app.</p><h3 id="browser">Browser</h3><p>Once you get used to it, moving away from <strong><a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc</a></strong> (on macOS) becomes really difficult. It’s also really interesting to follow closely such an active team, that comes up with new releases every few weeks (or maybe even more often). <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a></strong> is still my default on iPhone and iPad and sometimes I open it up on my MacBook as well.</p><h3 id="task-manager">Task manager</h3><p><strong><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank">Things</a></strong> is probably my favourite app in the world and I use <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841" target="_blank">Reminders</a></strong> only for some shared lists. I tried to make the switch and move everything there but it didn’t work. There’s just an abyss that separates the two. For work related tasks and documentation, everything is in <strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a></strong> since that’s what we use.</p><h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3><p>Even if it’s not for everyone, I love almost everything about <strong><a href="https://mymind.com/" target="_blank">mymind
</a></strong>. Sure, their app could be improved a bit but the simplicity of just throwing everything in there and being sure you’ll find it again is priceless<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://iamfran.com/archives/apps-default-2023#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Whenever I let my subscription expire, I regret it shortly after. Also, amazing approach at privacy and principles in general.</p><h3 id="photo-shooting">Photo shooting</h3><p>For some reason I renewed <strong><a href="https://halide.cam/" target="_blank">Halide</a></strong> but the reality is that the default <strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/camera-basics-iph263472f78/ios" target="_blank">Camera</a></strong> app covers 99% of my needs. I still enjoy using <strong><a href="https://spectre.cam/" target="_blank">Spectre</a></strong> for long exposures, especially when crowds are involved.</p><h3 id="photo-editing">Photo editing</h3><p>I’ve been using <strong><a href="https://lightroom.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Lightroom</a></strong> for so many years that I don’t even want to think about moving somewhere else, honestly. That being said, next year I want to try a cheaper solution (still need to figure out what that might look like).</p><h3 id="notes-1">Notes</h3><p>Apple <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109" target="_blank">Notes</a></strong> serves me perfectly well for my personal notes and, since it’s made by Apple, it integrates greatly with all my devices and offers good enough sharing features. Because I don’t want to mix research, personal, and work stuff, I use <strong><a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank">Bear</a></strong> for my research notes and <strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a></strong> (with my company account) for work related ones.</p><h3 id="writing">Writing</h3><p>If you want to write for real, focus deeply, and lose yourself in your world there is simply nothing better than <strong><a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer
</a></strong>.</p><h3 id="design">Design</h3><p>I’m so happy <strong><a href="https://figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a></strong> exists. The first thing I did when I started at Greenflux was to move all of our designs in there to allow better communication with other teams and hand-over to the developers. Sometimes, for quick personal stuff, I use <strong><a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/" target="_blank">Pixelmator Pro
</a></strong>, which is a great Photoshop replacement.</p><h3 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h3><p><strong><a href="https://cleanshot.com/" target="_blank">CleanShot X</a></strong> makes it a breeze to grab screenshots, record videos or gifts, and quickly edit them before sharing them. Amazing.</p><h3 id="read-later">Read later</h3><p>My requirements in this regards are just those of having a nice place where to store files for later. <strong><a href="https://goodlinks.app/" target="_blank">GoodLinks</a></strong> is a beautiful and extremely polished native app for iOS that costs only a few bucks once. Do you <em>really</em> need more than that? <sup><a target="_blank" href="https://iamfran.com/archives/apps-default-2023#fn:2">2</a></sup></p><h3 id="password-manager">Password manager</h3><p>As <a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb/app-defaults" target="_blank">Keenan</a> said “<strong>1Password</strong>, like a sane person”.</p><h3 id="music">Music</h3><p>I grew sick of how Spotify kept changing their UI and suggesting me stuff I wasn’t interested in so I tried <strong><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/browse" target="_blank">Apple Music
</a></strong>. Here I rediscovered the <em>old way</em> of listening to music: much more focused on albums, which is closer to how I organise music in my mind.</p><h3 id="messaging">Messaging</h3><p>I live in Europe so there really isn’t any alternative to <strong><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a></strong> here…</p><h3 id="sport">Sport</h3><p>I’m so happy with my <strong><a href="https://www.suunto.com/en-nl/Products/sports-watches/suunto-9-peak-pro/suunto-9-peak-pro-titanium-slate/" target="_blank">Suunto 9 Peak Pro</a></strong> that I’ll probably write something just about that. The app that comes with it is also much better than Garmin’s. That, paired with <strong><a href="https://www.freeletics.com/en/" target="_blank">Freeletics</a></strong> (which is the only app that keeps me on track with my exercises), is everything I need.</p><hr /><p><strong>Update [2024-01-05]:</strong> Added Design and Screenshots categories and links to all the apps.</p></div>
