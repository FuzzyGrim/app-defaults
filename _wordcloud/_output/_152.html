      <p>On <a target="_blank" href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">the ninety-seventh episode</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://hemisphericviews.com/">Hemispheric Views podcast</a>, which has gathered a storm of infamy and controversy, hosts <a target="_blank" href="https://grepjason.sh/">Jason</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://martinfeld.info/">Martin</a> squared off in a no holds barred competition over who might be the most default in their app choices, “helped” by <a target="_blank" href="https://canion.blog/">Andrew</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I am very late in participating, I understand this. As they say, the best time to plant a tree was 150 years ago, the second best time is now.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, there were no bad choices from either competitors. Thank goodness Andrew wasn’t a competitor. </p>
<p>But enough banter! For your consideration, here follows my answers to each of the questions posed.</p>

<p>💬 Chat: This is a bonkers category, because there is no default, so I refuse to play Andrew’s ridiculous game. The only reasonable answer is Messages.</p>

<p>🔩 Spreadsheets: Numbers</p>

<p>🧆 Meal planning: Again, balderdash. This category has no default. But being real, it’s Notes.</p>
<p>🏦 Budgeting and personal finance: Sigh, there is no real… nevermind, I’ll not chew my spinach thrice. Apps for the banking institutions with which I have accounts and a set of Numbers sheets.</p>
<p>📰 News: Apple News, do you need to know the feeds, really? Oh wait, is this kind of RSS? Hm.</p>
