<p>After seeing this on <a target="_blank" href="https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023">Kev Quirks</a> blog, I thought I would do the same. According to him, all the “cool kids” are doing it. I think my list is pretty solid right now, minus I’m toying with trying some other streaming services for music. If I think of anything else I’ll add it.</p>
