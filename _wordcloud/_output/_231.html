<div><p>After sharing a list of the <a target="_blank" href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/149/a1/where_have_i_been/">places I’ve been</a>, time to join in with another popular blogging topic which involves <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">people sharing the default apps</a> they currently use.</p>
<p>As you’ll see, I score pretty highly on my dependence on the ‘default’ default apps, and so the less said about my reliance on Apple’s offerings, the better.</p>

📨 Mail client
<dd>macOS Mail.</dd>
📮 Mail server
<dd>My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/">Mythic Beasts</a> server. In the past I’ve considered going all in on iCloud now that you can <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212514">use a custom domain name</a>, or using a service like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a>, but transferring my mail archive would be a lot of faff with risk of data loss all for little gain. Never Gmail.</dd>
🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts
<dd>macOS Contacts.</dd>
🗓️ Calendar
<dd>macOS Calendar.</dd>
🗒️ Notes
<dd>macOS Notes.</dd>
✅ To do
<dd>macOS Reminders. Having tried many times to avoid keeping to do lists in Notes, this year I’ve finally managed to start using Reminders. Of all the apps bundled with macOS, this is by far the worst. Bloated with features, fiddly to use, and not that nice to look at, either.</dd>
💬 Chat
<dd>Messages ideally, but in most cases WhatsApp. Not by choice, this being the one reluctant exception to my otherwise successful boycott of Facebook’s Meta’s products.</dd>
🌐 Web browsing
<dd>Safari… though I’m edging closer to giving <a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> a try.</dd>
📷 Photo shooting
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/cameras/x-s20/">Fujifilm X-S20</a> (iPhone 11 Pro through gritted teeth).</dd>
🎞️ Photo organisation
<dd>macOS Photos. Having been burnt by Adobe enough times over the years and weary of their monopoly over creative apps, I won’t use Lightroom. This means begrudgingly relying on Photos which redeems itself thanks to its iCloud integration. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_(software)">Aperture</a> remains sorely missed.</dd>
🌅 Photo editing
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/">Pixelmator Pro</a> which all too often fills the gaps in Photos lacklustre editing tools.</dd>
📖 Feeds
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, synced using iCloud.</dd>
📑 Read It Later
<dd>In theory I have an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> account, but in practice it doesn’t matter. I’ve stopped saving long-form articles to read later and instead leave them unread in my feed reader.</dd>
🔖 Bookmarks
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>? Again, I’ve stopped managing bookmarks as I realised that I rarely return to them.</dd>
🔐 Password management
<dd>macOS Passwords.</dd>
📄 Word processing
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> – points awarded for its <a target="_blank" href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">Micropub</a> support.</dd>
📈 Spreadsheets
<dd>I enjoy using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Sheets</a> for work, even more so since experiencing the embarrassing shit show that is Microsoft 365. For personal stuff, its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/numbers/">Numbers</a>.</dd>
📊 Presentations
<dd>Typically <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a>, but I created my presentation for UX London using <a target="_blank" href="https://ia.net/presenter">iA Presenter</a> and it was a revelation.</dd>
📰 News
<dd>No apps, just visiting websites such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk">The Guardian</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>…</dd>

<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> – a rare divergence from Apple’s default.</dd>
📐 Design
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a>. Never Figma.</dd>
👨🏼‍💻 Code
<dd><a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> – though I’d really like to say <a target="_blank" href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a>.</dd>
📁 Cloud file storage
<dd>iCloud Drive, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> used to access my FTP server.</dd>
🐘 Mastodon
<dd>The beautifully designed <a target="_blank" href="https://elk.zone/">Elk</a> on my desktop, and the equally lovely <a target="_blank" href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">official Mastodon app</a> on iOS which people unfairly criticise and I have no idea why.</dd>
