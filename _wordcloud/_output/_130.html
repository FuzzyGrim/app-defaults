        <p>I stumbled upon this by reading <a target="_blank" href="https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023">Kev’s great blog</a> but it seems there are a <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">bunch of people currently sharing their default apps</a>.</p>
<p>For me, always looking for a new app to improve my workflow, this is great. However, I had to notice that many people - like myself - stick with the default apps of their operating system. But, I will scroll through all other contributions to check if there is something to try out for me.</p>
