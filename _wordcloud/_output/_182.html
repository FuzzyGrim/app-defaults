<p>Why not do an old school blogging meme for day 13?  Well, that’s what I’m doing today, so… let’s go!  I’ve seen it a couple of places, but I last saw it <a target="_blank" href="https://manuelmoreale.com/app-defaults">over here</a>, which is where I was convinced that it would be today’s post.</p>
<p>I’m pretty much all Apple for end-user things.  I’m also an Ubuntu users, but I pretty much only interact with it via the command line.</p>
