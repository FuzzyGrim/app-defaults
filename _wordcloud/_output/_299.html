<p>As 2024 nears, I wanted to look at the applications I use every day. Am I using the best options that support my personal and professional goals? Am I spending too much money on silly subscriptions? What can I bring in-house? Is this all over-hyped productivity crap? <em>Oof.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after creating my omg.lol account, I came across Robb Knight's post - <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">Hemispheric Views - App Defaults</a> .  Inspired by the countless folks who contributed, I figured I would throw my hat in the ring for an introductory Weblog post.</p>
<p>I will be reviewing and revising this list over 2024. What will I be using next year? Will my goals even be the same? I'm excited about the idea of personal change-logs, and this seems like a great place to start.</p>
