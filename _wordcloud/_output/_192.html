<div>  <h2> App Defaults 2023  </h2>  <div>  <p>Here’s a little trend for 2023 that’s going around: listing out the default apps (and tools!) that I’ve used in 2023. I enjoy this little go around, as I’ve been getting to discover new apps that I might want to try.</p>
<p>I also did <a target="_blank" href="https://paularmstrong.dev/blog/2022/10/18/current-tool-chest/">something similar</a> last year, but in a much more limited capacity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>📨 Mail client:</span>
<ul>
<li>Personal: <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mail/id1108187098">Apple Mail</a> – I’m transitioning my personal life away from GMail and Google services. Who knows if Apple is actually <em>better</em> from a privacy standpoint, but I already pay for iCloud and own my own domain. It has worked will for the past half of this year.</li>
<li>Work: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">Gmail</a>, but <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104996">saved to the Dock</a> through Safari.</li>
</ul>

<p>📮 Mail server: (see also <a target="_blank" href="https://paularmstrong.dev/blog/2023/11/27/apps-tools-for-2023/#mail">Mail client</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/mail-on-icloudcom-overview-mm6b1a17e3/icloud">iCloud Mail</a></li>
<li>Work: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">Gmail</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>📆 Calendar: (see also <a target="_blank" href="https://paularmstrong.dev/blog/2023/11/27/apps-tools-for-2023/#mail">Mail client</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: Apple Calendar – fits with the whole <em>moving away from Google</em> thing.</li>
<li>Work: Google Calendar – Again, I don’t have a choice on this, but I <em>do</em> have the app <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/104996">saved to Dock</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span>📝 Notes:</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a></p>
<p>I had a lot of hesitation with Notion until I was forced to use it through work. I would prefer an open source alternative, but none have as powerful of database features as Notion does and I’m making heavy use of them.</p>
<p>I was previously trying to use <a target="_blank" href="https://paularmstrong.dev/blog/2023/11/27/apps-tools-for-2023/#cloud-files">Nextcloud</a> to handle notes and many other things, but the web UI is slow and painfully cumbersome.</p>
</li>

<p>✅ To-Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: <a target="_blank" href="https://paularmstrong.dev/blog/2023/11/27/apps-tools-for-2023/#notion">Notion</a> – with heavy use of database tables and ability to cross-link items to other pages in Notion really helps me keep track of what I’ve got going on.</li>
<li>Open source: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/paularmstrong">GitHub issues</a></li>
<li>Work: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shortcut.com/">Shortcut</a> – I dislike this tool almost as much as JIRA. It gets too complicated as soon as managers, project managers, compliance, and legal start adding requirements.</li>

<p>I keep this privately hosted. It’s nice to know that my files are actually <em>my</em> files. I also have quite a few local backups.</p>

<p>🎵 Music: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/">Plexamp</a></p>
<p>I have a very large library of music collected over more than two decades. I just can’t let go of the super rare albums and EPs that will never be on any of the cloud services.</p>

<li>
<p>🎤 Podcasts: None. I can’t pay attention to podcasts and do anything else at the same time.</p>

<p>🧑‍💻 Code Editor: <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></p>
<p>I reluctantly gave up trying to continue using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. It took me 4 tries over nearly as many months to get VSCode configured in a way that didn’t feel overly intrusive. There are still a lot of quirks about it that I don’t like, but being on the same editor as those I work with has been really helpful.</p>

<p>☕️ No sleep: <a target="_blank" href="https://keepingyouawake.app/">KeepingYouAwake</a></p>
<p>Don’t tell your IT/security team about this. When you work from home and work requires and resets your screensaver/sleep timeout down to 5 minutes, waking up and logging into your computer can be a nuisance when you make frequent kitchen &amp; bathroom breaks. This little gem can keep your computer active for hours – no mouse jiggler required.</p>

<p>I’ve bound a bunch of custom keyboard shortcuts for organizing windows across my screen(s). This has been a staple of my productivity toolchain for years.</p>
