    <p>It’s time for a new year and so, inspired by an <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">initiative spawned by the Hemipsheric Views podcast and further expanded by Robb Knight</a> for folks to share their default apps, I thought I’d share a default app list of my own! This is primarily focused on stuff I use outside of my actual job, which also means my list is extremely iPhone and iPad focused. I have a personal Mac, but I use it shockingly little as of late.</p>
<p>📨 Mail Client</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Gmail</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fastmail-email-calendar/id931370077?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Fastmail</a> for iOS. I don’t particularly love them, but they do the job.</li>
  <li>RIP <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9873268/why-dropbox-mailbox-shutdown">Mailbox</a>, the only good mobile email app</li>
</ul>
<p>📮 Mail Server</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> for personal. Because of course it is. I certainly don’t use Yahoo! mail.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> for domain mail. Particularly good is you have a bunch of domains you want to manage on one account.</li>
</ul>
<p>📝 Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Apple Notes</a>. I find the system app to be sufficient for the vast majority of my quick note-taking needs.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-private-diary/id1044867788?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Day One</a> for journaling. I highly recommend everyone try journaling, at least for a bit. It may not be for you, but I find that getting whatever thoughts I have out of my head to be immensely valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ To-Do</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Reminders</a>. I have no formal task management system. It mostly boils down to “<em>Siri, remind me to do laundry tomorrow at 11 AM</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>📷 iPhone Photo Shooting</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/camera/id1584216193?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Camera</a>. I’ve tried third party camera apps and, while they’re great, they never end up sticking for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>🟦 Photo Management</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos/id1584215428?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">iCloud Photos</a>. I live in the ecosystem, and so iCloud is all I really need for photo management.</li>
</ul>
<p>🎞️ Image and Vector Editors</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905?mt=12&amp;itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Pixelmator Pro</a>. Truly one of my favorite apps and developers of all time. They make a stellar image editor and have been continually improving it for over a decade.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Pixelmator for iOS</a>. You’d think it would be hard to do complex image edits on a phone, but I’ve done this time and time again. If I have an idea for some silly meme, I can make it on my phone right then and there.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer-2/id1616831348?mt=12&amp;itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Affinity Designer 2</a>. I’m not great at making vector graphics, but the Affinity suite is still a really great tool whenever I need to make some.</li>
</ul>
<p>🎬 Video Editor</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12&amp;itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Final Cut Pro</a> for Mac. I’m far from a professional, but I always find a great deal of joy whenever I open Final Cut. It makes editing fun for me.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">LumaFusion</a> for iPad and iPhone. This serves a similar purpose to Pixelmator for iOS. Good for making quick meme videos. I’m not at all competent at using it well, but it’s a good tool to have if I need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>🎧 Audio Editor</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro/id634148309?mt=12&amp;itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Logic Pro</a> for Mac. Logic is super powerful, and I barely know how to use it. But it’s got everything I need if I want to play around with music, edit podcast-style stuff, or just clip something out. Not as fun as Final Cut though.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Ferrite</a> for iPad. It’s incredible what you can do with this app. It makes it easy to work on podcast-style audio with the same speed I might in Logic, but on a much more comfortable device.</li>
</ul>
<p>📆 Calendar</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> via <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendar/id1108185179?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Apple Calendar</a> app. Nothing special.</li>
</ul>
<p>📁 Cloud File Storage</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive">iCloud Drive</a>. I don’t rely that much on cloud storage beyond basic documents, where iCloud Drive is sufficient</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> for sharing files, because iCloud is still not quite sufficient in that area..</li>
</ul>
<p>📖 RSS</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not a frequent user, but <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">NetNewsWire</a> when doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p>🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contacts/id1069512615?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">iCloud Contacts</a>. Why are these in iCloud but my calendar is in Google? I don’t really know.</li>
</ul>
<p>🌐 Browser</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> on Mac. I love love love some of its UI innovations. The sidebar and Mini Arc are truly great features.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safari/id1146562112?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Safari</a> on iPhone and iPad. Safari is the only browser on iOS that supports extensions, so I wouldn’t even consider switching.</li>
</ul>
<p>💬 Chat</p>
<p>I will basically use whatever app I need to to reach folks</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/messages/id1146560473?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">iMessage</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.messenger.com/">Messenger</a></li>
  <li>I have others but don’t really use them…</li>
</ul>
<p>🗣️ Social apps</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Ivory</a> for Mastodon, connecting to the very nice <a target="_blank" href="https://snailedit.social/about">snailedit.social</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a>, for the people who aren’t on Mastodon</li>
</ul>
<p>🔖 Bookmarks</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safari/id1146562112?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Safari</a>. But tbh I basically never make bookmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>📑 Read It Later</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodlinks/id1474335294?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">GoodLinks</a>. A really nice app with a really easy to use extension that I don’t use nearly enough. I add a bunch of stuff there, sure. But I don’t often go to actually read it.</li>
</ul>
<p>📜 Word Processing</p>
<p>Equal opportunity word processing!</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> for collaboration</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Pages</a> for personal things</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word">Microsoft Word</a> for more formal things</li>
</ul>
<p>📈 Spreadsheets</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://sheets.google.com/">Google Sheets</a>. Numbers confuses me and Excel sheets are harder to live collaborate on, so Google Sheets it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>📊 Presentations</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id409183694?mt=12&amp;itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Keynote</a>. There really is no comparison here. Keynote is ahead of the other presentation apps by a mile. It’s another one of those apps that feels fun to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>🎵 Music</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Apple Music</a>. I like the library-focused approach Apple takes, as I’d built up my iTunes library for years before Apple Music launched, and still add in a bunch of stuff that isn’t on Apple Music to my library regularly. I also find their playlists and some of their radio shows to be quite good.</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/sonos-radio">Sonos Radio</a>. It may have ads, but I find their mixes to be quite solid, and wish they offered more than radio.</li>
  <li>Rarely <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">YouTube Music</a> if I’m looking for something not on Apple Music</li>
</ul>
<p>🎤 Podcasts</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">Overcast</a>. Which gets <em>a lot</em> of use.</li>
</ul>
<p>🔐 Password Management</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id1511601750?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;itscg=30200">1Password</a>. I don’t despise 1Password 8 like many do, but it can be frustrating at times. In general, though, I still find it to be the tool that fits my needs the best. Except…</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/passkeys-passwords-devices-iph82d6721b2/ios">iCloud Keychain</a> for Passkeys. I find the system integration for passkeys to be smoother, at least for now. Maybe this will change in the future, but I’m split at present.</li>
</ul>
<p>📋 Clipboard Manager</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://tapbots.com/pastebot/">Pastebot</a>. Everybody should use a clipboard manager. They;re truly invaluable tools that can change how you work, I find that Pastebot’s simple overlay and features like sequential paste work well for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>🧑‍💻 Code Editor</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. I’ve tried everything, but always keep coming back to VS Code. Yes, it’s Electron. But it has every feature I need, extensions for any language I will ever use, and works everywhere. As someone who primarily works with JavaScript, it works great for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>⌨️ Terminal</p>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a>. The built-in macOS terminal is fine, but I appreciate the extra customization options that iTerm provides.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s my list! I hope you found something interesting in the list. And be sure to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">Robb’s web page</a> which links to everyone else’s app defaults.</p>
