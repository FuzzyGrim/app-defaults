<p>I originally saw <a target="_blank" href="https://social.lol/@robb/111530441223326924">this post on Mastodon</a> about App Defaults and how a load of people's defaults were shared and collected in one place. As part of the push to start writing, why not check my own defaults, and see how much of an impact they have on my use.</p>
<p>The list of categories can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">original post</a>, and there's even an RSS feed linked there, which you can follow for updates when more default lists are added!</p>
<p>On to the main event, with some reasoning. Maybe the <em>what</em> will still be the same in a few years, but I wonder if the <em>why</em> will be any different.</p>
