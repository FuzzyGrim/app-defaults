    <p>Before I share my list: am I the only one who thinks of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDjpOrlfh0Y">this song</a> when seeing people post their list? (itâ€™s okay if itâ€™s only me, really. At least Iâ€™ve made you listen to one of my favourite songs!)</p>
<p>First heard from <a target="_blank" href="https://micro.blog/maique">@maique</a> about <a target="_blank" href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">Duel of the Defaults</a> and then started reading all defaults posts and had to make mine too.</p>
<p>I did add a category, because Iâ€™m a reader ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>Oh and I annotate. A lot. Not going to apologise for that!</p>
<ul>
